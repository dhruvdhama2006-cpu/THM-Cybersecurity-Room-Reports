THM Penetration Testing 1 (PT1) Pathway Reports

This repository serves as a portfolio documenting my hands-on experience and analytical skills developed by completing security challenges specifically within the TryHackMe Penetration Testing 1 (PT1) Learning Path.

The primary goal of these reports is to demonstrate proficiency in documenting complex attack methodologies and articulating the chain of exploitation from initial vulnerability discovery to achieving Remote Code Execution (RCE), focusing on the core, foundational topics of web and infrastructure penetration testing covered in the PT1 track. Each report focuses on the technical methodology, tools utilized, and the core security principles mastered.

📝 PT1 Room Analysis

Below is an index of completed rooms from the Penetration Testing 1 pathway, highlighting the core concepts mastered.

1. File Inclusion

Vulnerabilities Explored: Local File Inclusion (LFI), Remote File Inclusion (RFI), and Path Traversal.

Key Techniques: Log Poisoning (for RCE), Directory Traversal (../), and reading sensitive system files.

Attack Chain Summary: Successfully demonstrated how LFI can be escalated to Remote Code Execution (RCE), establishing a direct functional link to Command Injection principles.
